Semiotic is a data visualization framework combining React &amp; D3

This is a fork of
[semiotic](https://github.com/emeeks/semiotic) with a pared
down version of the examples in the docs folder.

Instead of linking to the components in the src folder I pull
in the semiotic repo instead.

This repo shows a very nice example of how to implement Material Design using 
[material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
which is a set of React components that implement
Google's Material Design.
